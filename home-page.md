# What to Expect

Starting therapy can feel vulnerable — your first step doesn’t have to be overwhelming.

**Together, we will:**

1. Explore what’s bringing you to therapy
2. Clarify how you want your life to feel
3. Identify patterns and emotional blocks
4. Build new tools for connection, confidence, and resilience

The goal is to create a supportive space where you feel seen, understood, and empowered to grow.
